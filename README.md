We will be using Pandas and NumPy for this analysis. We will also be playing around with visualizations using the Seaborn library.Also will find out correlation between the features from this dataset. Let us understand how to explore the cars.csv dataset using Python.
1. Loading the Cars.csv Dataset.
2. Removing irrelevant features.
3. Finding duplicate data.
4. Finding the missing or null values
5. Visualizing Heatmaps.

I have wrtten an article first time about correlation and I am using Pandas and NumPy for this analysis. [Check it out](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/correlation-simple-seaborn-pandas-abishek-james/)
